I ask my mother to pause the clock,
I hate how it sounds: tick-tock, tick-tock.
But she looks at me and says,
“We don’t own a clock, my dear,” and I wonder
if something is wrong with my ears.

I go to make the tea to fight the chill,
I don’t like how this weather makes me feel.
But sunlight streams through a crack on the counter,
so I check my temperature, and I wonder
if something’s wrong with my body.

I love how the nail polish smells
more than its glossy look.
But today, the smell seems out of place. 
I wrinkle my nose, and I wonder
if something is wrong with my nose.

Hours have passed since my last meal,
my favorite dinner stays untouched. 
But my stomach caves in, my appetite is gone, and I wonder
if something is wrong with my stomach. 

I love to create stories in my head,
but today, they have jagged edges and plot holes I can’t fill. 
It’s like watching a train speed by while I stand still, and I wonder
if something is wrong with my imagination?

I see a grubby man, wearing a big diamond ring,
being chased by an elephant that pushes me into the river,
only to wake in my bed, unsure
if I drifted to sleep or dreamed wide awake, and I wonder
if something is wrong with my head.

I ask my mother again to pause the clock,
I hate how loud the tick-tock sound is.
Again, she looks at me and says,
“We don’t own a clock, my dear,” and I wonder
if something is wrong with my ears,
or if something is wrong with me.
