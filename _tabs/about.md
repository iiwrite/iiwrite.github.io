This is Subekshya Dani. I first wrote a poem and was proud a bit during time of COVID-19. I had locked myself from the world. The world of isolation brought out a writer in me, I didn't know existed. However, since I ran out of ideas to write about, I stopped. I barely wrote, and recently I decide to make a website to create a habit of writting and expose myself to the world, so that my creation doesn't stay in the closet forever.
